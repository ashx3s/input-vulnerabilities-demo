## Questions

- Why is input validation critical for web security?
- What makes sql injection a common vulnerability? why is it dangerous?
- What are common pitfalls developers face when implementing validation?

## Input Validation Quick Notes

- Syntactic (enforce ccorrect syntax)
- Semantic (enforce correct values for their context)
- Client side (validation done at the point where users input content -- can be circumvented with web proxys): this improves UX more
- Server side (validation on the server before the data is processed by the application): this improves security more
